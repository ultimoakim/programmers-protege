# :pencil2: Description
Programmer's Protégé is a friendly website that is made for any and all developers! The website can only benefit you, the developer, since creating posts is all a personal journey. There is no need to compare oneself to others, as you are writing posts to solidify what you have learned throughout software development.

# 🔋 Functionalities/Features
The user can create a post about anything they have learned from their journey in software development. Of course, the users should always be taking their posts seriously (if they want to improve)!

# 🐞 Bugs/Bug Fixes
* Fixed a bug where other users could edit/delete other users' posts

# :snowflake: Possible Future Ice Box Features
* Adding a favorites/likes feature so that users can keep track of which posts they really liked
* Possible style changes
* Being able to reply to another person's comment in a thread

# 📲 Updates
(TBA)

# ⚠️ My Biggest Problems and How I Solved Them
* Figuring out how to convert JavaScript elements to HTML. This problem was solved by simply using the EJS `<%- %>` tags (A.K.A the "half-squids").
* How to edit/update/delete comments on a post. This problem hasn't been resolved just yet, but it is being worked on.

# Things I Really Could Have Done Better/Skills to Improve For The Future
* I was too focused on trying to remember all the concepts that I learned. The truth is, I could have easily plowed through this project had I just thought more about implementing features instead of learning.
